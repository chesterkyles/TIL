# HTTP Tests

## Getting Started
Laravel provides a very fluent API for making HTTP requests to your application and examining the responses. For example, take a look at the feature test defined below:
```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\WithoutMiddleware;
use Tests\TestCase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    /**
     * A basic test example.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function test_a_basic_request()
    {
        $response = $this->get('/');

        $response->assertStatus(200);
    }
}
```

The `get` method makes a `GET` request into the application, while the `assertStatus` method asserts that the returned response should have the given HTTP status code. In addition to this simple assertion, Laravel also contains a variety of assertions for inspecting the response headers, content, JSON structure, and more.
