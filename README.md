TIL: Today I Learned

The following are the summary of the things that I learned in a daily basis whether by reading books, articles or by trying to implement state-of-the-art technologies. Note that what I have written are just concise explanations on various technologies that I am trying to learn. Also, some of them are mere summarized version of the official documentation since the documentation is better in explaining things than me :relaxed:. The things that I listed below are based on the learnings I had while doings tasks and/or knowledge acquired from implementing/coding whenever something catches my interest.
